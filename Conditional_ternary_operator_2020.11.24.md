[Conditional (ternary) operator / condition ? ifTrue : ifFalse](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator)

Note all three parameters ONLY accept an "expression", i.e. supplying a statement won't work.

> ### Parameters
>#### *`condition`*
>An expression whose value is used as a condition.
>#### *`exprIfTrue`*
>An expression which is evaluated if the *`condition`* evaluates to a truthy value (one which equals or can be converted to `true`).
>#### *`exprIfFalse`*
>An expression which is executed if the *`condition`* is falsy (that is, has a value which can be converted to `*false*`).
