[Object Oriented Programming: Define a Constructor Function](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/object-oriented-programming/define-a-constructor-function)

>...Constructors follow a few conventions:
>* Constructors are defined with a ***capitalized name*** to distinguish them from other functions that are not `constructors`.
>* Constructors use the keyword `this` to set properties of the object they will create. Inside the constructor, ***`this` refers to the new object it will create***.
>* Constructors ***define properties and behaviors instead of returning a value*** as other functions might.
