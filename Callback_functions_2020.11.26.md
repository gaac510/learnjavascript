[Wikipedia: Callback (computer programming)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callback_(computer_programming))

>...any executable code that is passed as an argument to other code; that other code is expected to **call back (execute)** the argument at a given time. This execution may be immediate as in a synchronous callback, or it might happen at a later time as in an asynchronous callback.
