[MDN - strict mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode)
>This syntax **has a trap** that has [already bitten](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=579119) [a major site](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=627531): it isn't possible to blindly concatenate conflicting scripts. Consider concatenating a strict mode script with a non-strict mode script: the entire concatenation looks strict! The inverse is also true: non-strict plus strict looks non-strict. Obviously, concatenation of scripts is never ideal, but if you must, consider enabling strict on a function-by-function basis.

>You can also take the approach of wrapping the entire contents of a script in a function and having that outer function use strict mode. This eliminates the concatenation problem and it means that you have to explicitly export any shared variables out of the function scope.
