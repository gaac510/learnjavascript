>...Whenever JavaScript executes a function, a 'scope' object is created to hold the local variables created within that function. It is initialized with any variables passed in as function parameters. This is similar to the global object that all global variables and functions live in, but with a couple of important differences: firstly, a brand new scope object is created every time a function starts executing, and secondly, unlike the global object (which is accessible as `this` and in browsers as `window`) **these scope objects cannot be directly accessed from your JavaScript code.** There is no mechanism for iterating over the properties of the current scope object, for example.
